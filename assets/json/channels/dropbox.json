A typical chunk is 4 MB. Using large chunks will mean fewer calls to /chunked_upload and faster overall throughput. However, whenever a transfer is interrupted, you will have to resume at the beginning of the last chunk, so it is often safer to use smaller chunks.If the offset you submit does not match the expected offset on the server, the server will ignore the request and respond with a 400 error that includes the current offset. To resume upload, seek to the correct offset (in bytes) within the file and then resume uploading from that point.A chunked upload can take a maximum of 24 hours before expiring."
